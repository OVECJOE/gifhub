# gifhub

A global hub for high-quality GIFs.

## Inspiration

I started building MemeFrame earlier this year, but abandoned the project halfway. MemeFrame was intended to enable anyone to generate memes from videos. The API was nearly completed, but then I found that it wasn't exactly useful. Most people already have the images they use for memes, and I was bad at using memes.

> This was where the idea was birthed.

## What it does

**GIFHub** enables anyone to upload a video and select timeframes from the video to convert to GIFs. GIFs can then be organized into repositories based on certain tags and can be made public for anyone to access and view its details via a link. High quality repos (as evaluated by the system) can be sold by the ownerâ€¦and much more (with time).

## How we built it

It is still currently in development phase and I encourage you to join me if you are interested. Let's build a global hub for GIFs.
